# GrassScript

GrassScript is a web-based application designed to help users map out their backyard or any grassy area, calculate the area, perimeter, and estimate the amount of grass seed required to cover the space. The application utilizes Leaflet.js for interactive mapping and geocoding features, allowing users to search for addresses and visualize geographical data.

## Features

- **Interactive Mapping**: Users can click on the map to mark the vertices of their backyard or area of interest.
- **Area Calculation**: Automatically calculate the area and perimeter of the marked area.
- **Seed Estimation**: Estimate the number of grass seed bags needed based on the area.
- **Address Search**: Users can search for a specific address to quickly zoom into areas of interest.
